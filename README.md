This is a simple Shell Script which can be used for gathering Linux system artifacts for Digital Forensics and Incidence Response activities.

This script will generate a file named "Lin-IR-output.txt" in its current working directory, which captures all basic artefacts required for analysis.
Do run this script with root privilege.

**Note**: Script may not capture/run smootly on all linux variants and need to be tweaked accordingly.
